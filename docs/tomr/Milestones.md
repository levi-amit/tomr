- [x] Basic command prompt
	- [x] `help` - show nice string
	- [x] `exit` - quit command prompt
- [ ] Basic debugging capabilities in a separate module
	- [x] `spawn` - spawn new process with traceme
		- [ ] display nice error message on execvpe fail instead of child panic
		- [ ] accept words contained in quotes as single arguments for argv, same goes for the path
			- replace the `.split(' ')` iterator with something that handles quotes correctly prolly smth in std does that
				- crate `shell-words` seems to do that maybe 
		- [ ] make `start` to also perform a `continue` after spawning
	- [x] `continue` - ptrace_cont for specified debugee
	- [ ] `freeze` - pause specified debugee
	- [ ] `attach` - attach to existing process by PID
	- [x] `info` - view info about debugees
	- [x] basic signal handler for SIGCHLD stuff
		- [x] print stuff when child trapped or exits
			- [x] move printing to cli module
		- [x] pop debugee from vector when child exits or is killed, also show a message
		- [ ] move signal handling to a separate file
	- [ ] direct stdio of spawned processes to pipes from which output can be controlled and displayed nicely
- Redesign needs
	- [ ] redesign `dbg` API more generic to avoid having to convert everything to `Dbgid`
		- [[dbg API redesign.excalidraw|Redesign decisions]]
	- [x] Convert the `DEBUGEES` static var to a `RwLock` from `Mutex`
- [ ] Nice CLI
	- [ ] convert the big `handle_command_line` function match case to calls to smaller functions to handle parts of each user command
- [ ] More debugging capabilities
- [ ] Cursive UI
